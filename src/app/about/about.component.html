            As an interaction designer, my focus lies in developing innovative tools, systems, and creative solutions. I enjoy combining digital and physical solutions to create engaging user experiences.
            <br><br>
            My hobbies include sound design, game development, and engaging in physical activities. These personal interests contribute to the design of systems. For instance, sound design allows me to incorporate audio cues, while game development sharpens programming practices. Furthermore, engaging in physical activities helps me maintain a healthy physical and mental state.
            <br><br>
            My time as a student at Aalborg university has emphasized the significance of teamwork in my life. Collaborating with others has not only expanded my programming and design practices but has also exposed me to diverse perspectives and alternative approaches. Through these experiences, I have come to recognize the value of group work. I particularly enjoy working in teams as it allows for the development process to reach go further than doing it alone, with the collective contribution of multiple individuals.
