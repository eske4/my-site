        <h2>Creating and Evaluating Intelligent Systems</h2>
        <br>
        <p>In collaboration with a group of 5, we were assigned the task of developing an interactive 
            intelligent system. Our project focused on a mobile application designed to generate cycling 
            or walking routes based on points of interest. The project encompassed the entire product 
            development process, from the initial ideation to the creation of the final prototype. 
            <br><br>
            We followed the Double Diamond method, progressing through the Discover, Define, Develop, 
            and Deliver phases. During the Discover phase, we delved into interactive intelligent systems, 
            generated ideas, and conducted thorough research. Moving into the Define phase, we refined our 
            concept, prioritized requirements, and formulated a clear problem statement.  
            <br><br>
            My responsibilities during the development phase were the backend development in Unity, 
            architecting APIs using Python's Flask framework, and setting up a database with PostgreSQL 
            through the cloud service Supabase. Throughout this phase, I additionally conducted usability 
            tests, gathering essential feedback for use in iterative improvements. The adoption of a Kanban 
            workflow for task organization proved effective, and the project, along with a dedicated course, 
            expanded my proficiency in conducting tests 
            <br><br>
            The users expressed enthusiasm for exploring new neighbourhoods with the application together 
            with useful feedback for future enhancements. Suggestions included implementing unobtrusive audio 
            guidance, addressing music playback interruptions, and introducing user-preference-based sorting 
            for points of interest. 
            <br><br>
            The project equipped me with a versatile skill set in frontend, backend, and databases. While 
            Python served well for efficient feature testing, the project also highlighted its limitations 
            for API development. Moving forward, I aim to explore alternative languages for APIs while continuing 
            to leverage Python's strengths in swift feature testing.
