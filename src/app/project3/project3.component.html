        <h2>Interactive Installation at Trekanten</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This project involved the development of an interactive installation for the culture house "Trekanten," 
            with a focus on solving a problem while actively engaging users in the design process. My approach was 
            guided by the Simple Lifecycle Model, which included extensive research and user interviews at Trekanten, 
            the creation of personas and scenarios, and the iterative process of sketching and refining ideas.
            <br><br>
            Drawing inspiration from Nielsen's usability heuristics and Gestalt theory, we crafted the final design solution. 
            To showcase the design's functionality, we produced an augmented reality video as a high-fidelity prototype, effectively 
            demonstrating user-interface interactions and highlighting the interactive workshops at Trekanten.
            <br><br>
            The project aimed to address the underutilization of the Makerspace area at Trekanten. Through my research and interviews, 
            I identified the potential for an interactive prototype to spotlight the workshops and generate interest among users, with 
            a specific focus on the Makerspace's 3D printers due to their accessibility and versatility.
            <br><br>
            Throughout the design process, I created personas, sketches, and scenario sketches, employing the 10Plus10 sketching method to 
            refine design solutions. User feedback was actively sought through the Wizard of Oz method, influencing the development of the 
            final prototype.
            <br><br>
            I played a key role in designing the interface for the pedestal, ensuring it matched Trekanten's colors and included both Danish 
            and English versions for accessibility. To enhance user-friendliness, the pedestal lights up when approached, aiding users in discovering 
            the Makerspace and its creations.
            <br><br>
            In summary, this project provided me with valuable insights into the Simple Lifecycle Model, interview techniques, sketching and wireframing, 
            and collaborative design by actively involving users in the design process. The resulting prototype serves as a compelling solution to promote the 
            Makerspace, reflecting a thorough design process and a user-centric approach.
